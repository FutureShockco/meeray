# MeeRay API Documentation

Welcome to the MeeRay Sidechain API documentation. This API provides access to all the features of the MeeRay blockchain including tokens, NFTs, markets, pools, farms, and more.

## Getting Started

The MeeRay API is RESTful and returns JSON responses. All endpoints are prefixed with the base URL of your MeeRay node.

**Base URL:** `http://localhost:3001`

## Authentication

Currently, the API does not require authentication for read operations. Write operations are handled through Steem blockchain transactions.

## Rate Limiting

There are no rate limits currently implemented, but please be respectful of the server resources.

## Support

For support and questions, please visit our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/FutureShockco/meeray) or contact the development team.
