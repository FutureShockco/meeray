# MeeRay Multi-Layer Consensus Architecture

## Overview

MeeRay aim to introduce a revolutionary **multi-layer consensus architecture** where witnesses can opt into different application-specific consensus layers within the same sidechain network based on the Steem Blockchain. This innovative design enables specialized consensus mechanisms for different use cases while maintaining network unity and shared infrastructure.

## Core Concept: Consensus Layer Opt-In

### Traditional Single-Layer Approach
```
All Applications → Single Consensus → All Witnesses
  DeFi          ↘                  ↗
  Gaming         → Main Consensus  → 20 Witnesses (3s blocks)
  CMS           ↗                  ↘
  NFTs         ↙
```

### MeeRay's Multi-Layer Architecture
```
Applications → Specialized Consensus Layers → Opt-In Witnesses

DeFi/Core    → Main Consensus (Required)     → All 20 Witnesses (3s blocks)
CMS          → Content Consensus (Optional)  → Configurable Witnesses (3s blocks - Steem synced)  
Gaming       → Gaming Consensus (Optional)   → Configurable Witnesses (3s blocks - Steem synced)
Custom Apps  → App-Specific Layers          → Configurable Witnesses (3s blocks - Steem synced)
```

## Architecture Design

### Critical Constraint: Steem Block Synchronization

**Important**: All consensus layers in MeeRay must operate with the same 3-second block time because the network streams transactions from the Steem blockchain. This synchronization is essential for:

1. **Transaction Source**: All transactions originate from Steem blockchain via `custom_json` (or `comments` for cms) operations
2. **Block Processing**: Each MeeRay block must process a corresponding Steem block
3. **Network Integrity**: Breaking synchronization would halt the entire network
4. **Consensus Coordination**: All layers must advance together with each Steem block

**Performance optimization comes from:**
- **Witness participation**: Fewer witnesses = faster consensus within the 3-second window
- **Processing specialization**: Different witness sets optimized for different application types
- **Load distribution**: Not all witnesses need to process all transaction types

### 1. Main Consensus Layer (Required)
- **Purpose**: Core blockchain operations (transfers, DeFi, high-value transactions)
- **Participation**: **Mandatory** for all witnesses
- **Security**: Maximum (all witnesses participate)
- **Handles**:
  - Token transfers and core operations
  - DeFi protocols (pools, farms, markets)
  - High-value NFT transactions
  - Witness management
  - Cross-layer value settlement

### 2. CMS Consensus Layer (Optional)
- **Purpose**: Content management and publishing
- **Participation**: **Opt-in** for witnesses
- **Security**: Medium (subset of witnesses)
- **Handles**:
  - Blog posts and articles
  - Media uploads and metadata
  - Site configurations and themes
  - Comment systems and moderation
  - Content monetization

### 3. Gaming Consensus Layer (Optional)
- **Purpose**: Real-time gaming and interactive applications
- **Participation**: **Opt-in** for specialized gaming witnesses
- **Security**: Gaming-optimized (fewer witnesses, faster processing)
- **Handles**:
  - Player actions and movements
  - Game state updates
  - Real-time events (PvP, auctions)
  - In-game economies
  - Achievement systems

### 4. Custom Application Layers
- **Purpose**: Future application-specific needs
- **Participation**: **Configurable** opt-in system
- **Security**: **Flexible** based on witness participation requirements

## Witness Configuration System

### Enhanced Witness Registration
```typescript
interface WitnessConfig {
  pub: string;                    // Witness public key (current)
  consensusLayers: {
    main: true,                   // Required: always participate
    cms?: string[],                // Optional: content management
    gaming?: string[],            // Optional: specific game IDs
    custom?: string[]             // Optional: custom app layers
  };
  endpoints?: {
    main: string,                 // P2P endpoint for main consensus
    cms?: string,                 // Optional CMS-specific endpoint
    gaming?: string               // Optional gaming-specific endpoint
  };
}
```

### Example Witness Configurations

#### Full-Service Witness
```typescript
{
  name: "witness-alpha",
  pub: "...",
  consensusLayers: {
    main: true,
    cms: false,
    gaming: ["hariraid", "drugwars"],
    custom: ["dao_governance"]
  }
}
```

#### CMS-Optin Witness
```typescript
{
  name: "witness-cool",
  pub: "...",
  consensusLayers: {
    main: true,
    cms: true,
    gaming: [],
    custom: []
  }
}
```

#### Gaming-Specialized Witness
```typescript
{
  name: "hariraid-node",
  pub: "...",
  consensusLayers: {
    main: true,
    cms: false,
    gaming: ["hariraid"]
  }
}
```

## Transaction Routing

### Layer-Specific Transaction Types
```typescript
enum ConsensusLayer {
  MAIN = "main",
  CMS = "cms", 
  GAMING = "gaming",
  CUSTOM = "custom"
}

interface LayeredTransaction {
  type: TransactionType;
  consensusLayer: ConsensusLayer;
  data: any;
  // ... other fields
}
```

### Example Transaction Routing
```typescript
// High-value transfer → Main consensus (maximum security)
{
  type: TOKEN_TRANSFER,
  consensusLayer: "main",
  data: { to: "alice", amount: "1000000" }
}

// Blog post → CMS consensus (content-optimized)
{
  type: CMS_PUBLISH_POST,
  consensusLayer: "cms",
  data: { title: "...", content: "...", tags: [...] }
}

// Player action → Gaming consensus (ultra-fast)
{
  type: GAME_PLAYER_ACTION,
  consensusLayer: "hariraid",
  data: { playerId: "user123", action: "attack", target: "monster_456" }
}
```

}
```

## Community-Owned Infrastructure Model

### Small Team/Player Node Operation

**Revolutionary Concept**: Any small team or individual can run a MeeRay node to support their favorite application while earning from both the main network AND their custom application layer.

#### How It Works:
```typescript
// Example: Players running nodes for their favorite game
const playerNode = {
  participant: "gamer_alice",
  nodeType: "community",
  consensusLayers: {
    main: true,              // Earns MRY from main network
    hariraid: true          // Earns HARI tokens from game layer
  },
  benefits: [
    "Supports decentralization of their favorite game",
    "Earns MRY rewards from main consensus",
    "Earns HARI rewards from game consensus", 
    "Helps secure both networks",
    "Community ownership of game infrastructure"
  ]
}
```

#### Decentralized dApp Infrastructure:
- **Shared Database**: All nodes share the same blockchain state
- **Community Ownership**: Players/users become infrastructure owners
- **Dual Token Economy**: Earn from both MRY network + custom app tokens
- **Low Barrier**: Small teams can launch apps without massive infrastructure

### Custom Token Economy Design

Applications can create their own token economies on top of MeeRay:

```typescript
// Example: HariRaid game with custom HARI token
const gameEconomy = {
  mainNetworkToken: "MRY",           // Base network rewards
  customAppToken: "HARI",            // Game-specific rewards
  
  playerRewards: {
    playGame: "earn HARI tokens",
    runNode: "earn MRY + HARI tokens",
    participate: "support game infrastructure"
  },
  
  tokenUtility: {
    HARI: ["in-game purchases", "tournament entries", "node rewards"],
    MRY: ["cross-game value", "main network fees", "base rewards"]
  }
}
```

## Economic Model

### Multi-Layer Reward System

#### Main Network (MRY)
- **All Witnesses**: Earn MRY for main consensus participation
- **Base Rewards**: Standard witness rewards for core network security
- **Cross-Application Value**: MRY used across all applications

#### Application-Specific Layers (Custom Tokens)
- **Game Layers**: Witnesses earn game tokens (HARI, etc.)
- **CMS Layers**: Witnesses earn content platform tokens
- **Custom Apps**: Application-defined token rewards

#### Community Node Benefits
```typescript
// A player running a node for HariRaid game
const communityNodeEarnings = {
  mainConsensus: "100 MRY per month",      // From main network
  gameConsensus: "500 HARI per month",     // From game layer
  totalValue: "Dual token income stream",
  communityImpact: "Owns part of game infrastructure"
}
```

### Why This Creates a Win-Win for MeeRay

#### Network Effects:
1. **More Nodes**: Every popular game brings more infrastructure
2. **Decentralized Growth**: Applications fund their own infrastructure 
3. **Community Investment**: Players become stakeholders in their games
4. **Economic Alignment**: Success of apps = more MRY network usage

#### Revenue Streams for Applications:
- **Token Creation**: Launch custom tokens on MeeRay
- **Node Incentives**: Reward community for running infrastructure
- **Transaction Fees**: Generate revenue from application usage
- **Community Ownership**: Shared success model

### Fee Distribution
- **Layer-specific fees**: Distributed to participating witnesses in custom tokens
- **Main network fees**: Always distributed in MRY to all main consensus participants
- **Settlement fees**: Cross-layer transactions generate fees for both layers

## Security Considerations

### Layer Isolation
- **Fault Containment**: Issues in gaming layer don't affect DeFi
- **Security Gradation**: Higher security for higher value operations
- **Consensus Independence**: Each layer maintains its own consensus state

### Cross-Layer Security
- **Value Transfer Delays**: Higher settlement times for cross-layer value moves
- **Witness Overlap**: Ensure sufficient witness overlap between layers
- **Audit Trails**: Full transaction history across all layers

## Revolutionary Gaming & dApp Ecosystem

### Community-Driven Infrastructure

This model creates a **revolutionary paradigm** where applications and their communities co-own the infrastructure:

#### Traditional Gaming Infrastructure:
```
Game Company → Owns Servers → Players Pay → Company Profits
     ↓              ↓              ↓           ↓
Centralized    Expensive     Recurring    Extractive
```

#### MeeRay Gaming Infrastructure:
```
Players → Run Nodes → Earn Tokens → Shared Ownership
   ↓         ↓           ↓            ↓
Community  Distributed  Rewards   Collaborative
```

### Real-World Example: HariRaid Game

#### Player Journey:
1. **Play the Game**: Earn HARI tokens through gameplay
2. **Run a Node**: Earn MRY + HARI tokens for supporting infrastructure
3. **Own the Game**: Become part of the decentralized infrastructure
4. **Vote on Updates**: Community governance through token ownership

#### Benefits for Everyone:
```typescript
const ecosystemBenefits = {
  players: [
    "Earn tokens while playing",
    "Own part of game infrastructure", 
    "Vote on game development",
    "True digital asset ownership"
  ],
  
  developers: [
    "Community-funded infrastructure",
    "Built-in token economy",
    "Engaged stakeholder community",
    "Reduced operational costs"
  ],
  
  meerayNetwork: [
    "More nodes and decentralization",
    "Increased transaction volume",
    "Application ecosystem growth",
    "Network effect amplification"
  ]
}
```

### Application Deployment Model

#### Traditional dApp Deployment:
- ❌ Launch own blockchain (expensive)
- ❌ Deploy on Ethereum (high fees)  
- ❌ Use centralized servers (not decentralized)
- ❌ Complex infrastructure management

#### MeeRay dApp Deployment:
- ✅ **Register consensus layer** (simple config)
- ✅ **Community runs nodes** (players become infrastructure)
- ✅ **Custom token economy** (built-in monetization)
- ✅ **Shared security** (piggyback on MRY network)

### Economic Flywheel Effect

```
More Popular Games → More Players Running Nodes → Stronger MeeRay Network
        ↑                                                      ↓
Better Infrastructure ← More Developers Build Apps ← Network Effect Growth
```

#### Why This Creates Exponential Growth:
1. **Self-Reinforcing**: Success of any app strengthens the entire network
2. **Community Investment**: Players have skin in the game
3. **Low Entry Barrier**: Small teams can compete with big companies
4. **Shared Success**: Win-win for all participants

### Example: Small Team Success Story

```typescript
// Hypothetical: 2-person indie game studio
const indieGameStudio = {
  team: 2,
  gameIdea: "puzzle_adventure_game",
  
  traditionalPath: {
    serverCosts: "$5000/month",
    playerAcquisition: "$50,000",
    totalRisk: "High - central point of failure"
  },
  
  meerayPath: {
    infrastructureCosts: "$0 - community runs nodes",
    playerAcquisition: "Built-in - node runners become players",
    totalRisk: "Low - distributed infrastructure",
    
    launchSteps: [
      "1. Register 'puzzle_adventure' consensus layer",
      "2. Create PUZZLE token for rewards",
      "3. Launch with community node incentives",
      "4. Players earn PUZZLE + MRY for running nodes",
      "5. Game becomes community-owned infrastructure"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Future Possibilities
