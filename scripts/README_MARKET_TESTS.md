#    API should be accessible at http://localhost:3000

# 3. Run the comprehensive test suite
node scripts/advanced_hybrid_trade_test.cjs

### 2. `market_test_simple.cjs` - Quick Basic Tests

A simplified test script for quick validation of core trading functionality:

**Features:**
- üìà Market order with auto-routing
- üìä Limit order placement
- üõ°Ô∏è MinAmountOut protection test

**Usage:**
```bash
# 1. Ensure keys.json file is configured (same as above)

# 2. Run the simple tests
node scripts/market_test_simple.cjs
```

## Configuration

The scripts now follow the same structure as other MeeRay scripts:

**Requirements:**
- **`keys.json`** file in the scripts directory with account credentials:
  ```json
  ["your-private-posting-key-here"]
  ```
- **MeeRay node** running locally (API available at http://localhost:3000)
- **Account with sufficient balances** for testing

**Configuration variables** (can be edited in each script):
```javascript
// Test tokens
const TOKEN_A = 'MRY';
const TOKEN_B = 'STEEM';

// Test amounts (8 decimal precision)
const TEST_AMOUNTS = {
  SMALL: '1000000000',  // 10 tokens
  MEDIUM: '5000000000', // 50 tokens  
  LARGE: '10000000000'  // 100 tokens
};
```

## Test Types Explained

### Market Orders
- **Auto-routing**: System automatically finds best execution path
- **Slippage protection**: Uses `maxSlippagePercent` to limit price impact
- **Immediate execution**: Trades execute immediately at market prices

### Limit Orders  
- **Price specification**: User sets exact price for execution
- **Order book placement**: Orders wait in book until price is met
- **No slippage risk**: Price is guaranteed if order fills

### Slippage Protection
- **maxSlippagePercent**: Percentage-based protection (recommended)
- **minAmountOut**: Exact minimum output amount (advanced)
- **Smart routing**: System may route to orderbook if AMM slippage too high

### Route Types
- **AMM Routes**: Execute through liquidity pools
- **Orderbook Routes**: Execute through order matching
- **Hybrid Routes**: Combine multiple sources for optimal execution

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue**: "Trading pair not found"
**Solution**: Ensure trading pairs exist in the system. Create pairs first if needed.

**Issue**: "Insufficient balance"
**Solution**: Make sure test accounts have sufficient token balances.

**Issue**: "No liquidity available"
**Solution**: Add liquidity to pools or place orders in orderbooks.

**Issue**: "API connection failed"
**Solution**: Verify MeeRay node is running locally and API is accessible at http://localhost:3000.

**Issue**: "Error loading keys.json file"
**Solution**: Create a keys.json file in the scripts directory with your private posting key as a JSON array.

## Test Data Analysis

The comprehensive test suite generates detailed JSON reports including:

- Transaction IDs for each test
- Balance changes and confirmations
- API response data and timing
- Error details and debugging info
- Performance metrics and statistics

Use these reports to:
- Debug failed transactions
- Analyze system performance
- Validate trading logic
- Monitor slippage and routing efficiency

## Advanced Testing

For production systems, consider:

1. **Load Testing**: Run multiple concurrent trades
2. **Edge Case Testing**: Test with extreme amounts and prices
3. **Network Testing**: Test with network delays and failures
4. **Security Testing**: Test with malformed inputs and attacks
5. **Performance Testing**: Measure latency and throughput

## Support

If tests fail or you encounter issues:

1. Check the detailed error logs
2. Verify your configuration is correct
3. Ensure your node is fully synced
4. Check account balances and permissions
5. Review the generated test reports
